        <h2>What Is a Headcanon?</h2>
        <div class="content-grid">
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>A <strong>headcanon</strong> is a fan-created idea, interpretation, or belief about a fictional
                    character, story, or universe that isn't explicitly stated in the original source material. The term
                    combines "head" (referring to one's imagination) with "canon" (the official, established facts of a
                    story). Headcanons live in the space between what creators tell us and what we choose to believe.
                </p>

                <p>Think of headcanons as the creative extensions fans make to fill in the gaps left by authors,
                    screenwriters, and game developers. While the original creator might tell us a character loves
                    coffee, a headcanon might specify that they only drink it black, at exactly 6 AM, while reading the
                    newspaper—details that feel true to the character even without official confirmation.</p>

                <h3>Why Are Headcanons Important?</h3>
                <p>Headcanons serve many purposes in fan communities. They allow fans to explore character depth that
                    source material might not have time to address. Writers use headcanons to inform their fanfiction,
                    ensuring consistency in how they portray characters. Artists draw inspiration from headcanons to
                    create meaningful fan art that resonates with other fans who share similar interpretations.</p>

                <p>For many fans, headcanons are a way to see themselves represented in their favorite stories. LGBTQ+
                    headcanons, neurodivergent headcanons, and cultural headcanons allow fans to connect more deeply
                    with characters by imagining shared experiences and identities.</p>

                <h3>Examples of Popular Headcanons</h3>
                <p>Some headcanons become so widely accepted that they feel almost canon. For instance, many Harry
                    Potter fans headcanon that Hermione has naturally curly hair that she learned to manage over time.
                    In the Marvel fandom, it's common headcanon that Steve Rogers keeps a list of things to catch up on
                    from his years frozen. These ideas spread through fan communities, becoming shared understandings
                    that enrich everyone's experience of the original work.</p>

                <p>Our <strong>headcanon generator</strong> helps you create these personal interpretations for any
                    character you love. Whether you want wholesome comfort, comedic quirks, angsty backstories, or
                    emotional depth, you can generate ideas that spark your creativity and help you see familiar
                    characters in new ways.</p>

        <h2>Canon vs Headcanon: Understanding the Difference</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Understanding the difference between canon and headcanon is essential for any fan engaging with their
                favorite stories. While both contribute to how we experience fiction, they come from very different
                sources and serve different purposes in fan communities.</p>

            <p><strong>Canon</strong> refers to the official, established facts of a fictional universe as determined by
                its creators. This includes events that happen in the original books, movies, TV shows, games, or any
                media that the creator or rights holder has officially endorsed. Canon is "real" within the story's
                universe—it's what actually happened.</p>

            <p><strong>Headcanon</strong>, on the other hand, is personal and interpretive. It's what individual fans
                believe or imagine about characters and stories, even without official confirmation. Headcanons can
                coexist with canon, filling in gaps, or they can deliberately diverge from it in "alternate universe"
                interpretations.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Neither canon nor headcanon is "better"—they serve different purposes. Canon gives us
            shared stories to discuss, while headcanons allow personal expression and deeper connection. Many of the
            most beloved fan works come from headcanons that resonated so strongly they became community-wide
            interpretations.</p>

                    <span class="step-number">1</span>
                    <h3>Character Input</h3>
                    <p>You provide a character name and optionally select a fandom. This helps personalize the
                        headcanons to your specific character, making them feel more relevant and fitting.</p>

                <h3>🔒 Privacy & Data</h3>
                <p>We believe in complete transparency: This generator does not store any data you enter. Your character
                    names, fandom selections, and generated headcanons are processed in real-time and never saved to any
                    database. We don't use third-party AI services—all generation happens on our servers using our
                    proprietary template system.</p>
