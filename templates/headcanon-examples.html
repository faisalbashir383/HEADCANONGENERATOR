            <h2>How to Use These Headcanon Examples</h2>

            <p>These examples are meant to be starting points, not finished ideas. Here's how to make them your own:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adapt to your character:</strong> Take any headcanon and ask "how would [character]
                    specifically do this?" The details matter.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine ideas:</strong> Mix a wholesome headcanon with an angsty one for complex
                    characterization.</li>
                <li><strong>Add specificity:</strong> Instead of "they have a comfort food," specify what it is and why
                    it's meaningful.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore origins:</strong> For any headcanon, ask "why is this true?" The backstory often
                    becomes the story.</li>
                <li><strong>Share and discuss:</strong> Post your headcanons and see how others react—fandom is more fun
                    together.</li>
            </ul>

                            complexity to characters. Many fans enjoy exploring darker themes as a way to process their
                            own experiences or simply to appreciate well-developed characters. Just be mindful of
                            tagging appropriately when sharing content that might be heavy.</p>

                            you, and someone else's version belongs to them. The diversity of interpretation is part of
                            what makes fandom rich and interesting.</p>
