        <div class="legal-content">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Headcanon Generator was created with a simple goal: to help fans everywhere explore new dimensions of
                their favorite characters. We believe that creativity should be accessible to everyone, which is why our
                tool is completely free and always will be.</p>

            <h2>Who Built This</h2>
            <p>Headcanon Generator was created by <strong>Faisal Ahmad</strong>, a passionate developer and longtime fan
                who understands the joy of fandom creativity. As a fanfiction reader and community member, Faisal
                noticed a gap in free, high-quality creative tools for fans. This generator was built to be something
                fans would actually use—and now it's being shared with everyone.</p>

            <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
            <p>We've spent countless hours in fandom communities, reading fanfiction, creating fan art, and
                participating in roleplay. We know how powerful a single creative spark can be—how one headcanon can
                inspire an entire story, a piece of art, or a deep discussion with fellow fans. This tool exists to
                provide those sparks whenever you need them.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Our headcanon generator helps writers, artists, roleplayers, and fans create unique character
                interpretations. Whether you're looking for inspiration for your next fanfiction, developing a roleplay
                character, or just having fun imagining your favorite characters in new ways, we're here to spark your
                creativity.</p>

            <h2>Why Headcanons Matter</h2>
            <p>Headcanons are more than just fun fan theories—they're a form of creative expression that allows fans to
                connect with stories on a deeper level. They help us see ourselves in our favorite characters, fill in
                the gaps left by creators, and build communities around shared interpretations.</p>
